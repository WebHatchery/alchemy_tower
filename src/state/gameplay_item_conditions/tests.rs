/// One could not. `quarry_lichen_sparked` wants wind — wind is the whole
/// idea of a sparked lichen — and its ledge only ever appeared in clear or
/// mist, so eight quality points and a `volatile` trait had never once been
/// reachable. The ledge takes wind now; this stops the next one.
/// The reachability check above proves the conditions *can* line up. This
/// proves the payoff actually resolves when they do: on a clear winter
/// morning the pass flower should come up as its variant and be worth more
/// than the plain one, through the same call the game makes.
