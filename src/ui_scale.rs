//! Uniform down-scaling of the on-screen UI (HUD + modal overlays) for windows
//! smaller than the reference resolution.
//!
//! The HUD and overlays are authored for [`UI_DESIGN_W`] x [`UI_DESIGN_H`]. When
//! the window is at least that big everything uses real screen coordinates and
//! this module is a no-op (so large/normal windows are unaffected). When the
//! window is smaller, the UI is laid out at the design size and rendered into a
//! centered, uniformly scaled viewport (letterbox) — via the toolkit's
//! [`VirtualUi`] mapper — so its fixed-size panels stay readable and never
//! overlap. Mouse input for overlays is transformed back through the same scale
//! so clicks still land on the right controls.
